Apache kafka is a distributed partitioned, replicated commit log service. It provides the functionality of a messaging system but with a unique design.

Kafka is distributed and highly scalable.
It can grow elastically and transparently with no downtime. Kafka allows partition data streams and spread messages over a cluster of machines which allows data streams larger than a single machine could handle.

Kafka use cases

Messaging
Website Activity Tracking
Metrics
Log aggregation
stream processing

Main kafka concepts

Topics - feeds of messages are orgained into topics

Brokers - kafka runs on a cluster of servers

Producers - Processes that publish messages to a kafka topic

Consumers - Processes that subscribe to topics and process the feed of published messages
